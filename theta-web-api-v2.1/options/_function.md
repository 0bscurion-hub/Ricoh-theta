### Overview

Shooting function.  
Shooting settings are retained separately for both the Still image shooting mode and Video shooting mode.  
Setting them at the same time as exposureDelay will result in an error.

Can be acquired by [camera.getOptions](../commands/camera.get_options.md) and set by [camera.setOptions](../commands/camera.set_options.md).
