## Make your THETA by registering for the RICOH THETA Plugin Partner Program
The RICOH THETA Plugin Partner Program supports RICOH THETA plugin development with an Android-based OS.

RICOH THETA cameras now have an open API / SDK that both individuals and corporations can access. Everyone with an Android-based RICOH THETA camera can install programs (plugins) into the RICOH THETA. You develop the plugin using our API / SDK and Android Studio and are free to expand the functions of the RICOH THETA.

Plugin can only run on supported THETA models.

See [the overview page](./theta.md) for more detail.

Plugins you develop can be made available to the public at the RICOH THETA PLUGIN STORE. This will allow developers to share your plugin widely with many THETA users.

* The partner program is a service that supports the development of plugins that operate within the RICOH THETA itself. There is a separate SDK to develop RICOH THETA applications on smartphones. Information about the development of applications for smartphones is [here](./theta-api.md).

## What you can do with plugins
RICOH THETA plugins enable control over 360 shooting and image editing as well as control of the interface and sensors. Examples are below. For further information, please see [here](../../ricoh-theta-plugin/README.md).

#### USB
![theta_example1](../assets/img/products/theta-plugin/theta_example1.png)  
The USB port of the RICOH THETA can be assigned as USB Host. As long as the Android library is exposed, any device class can be used with the THETA Plugin SDK. This includes device classes such as HID, CDC, Audio Class, and more, as well as unique classes that vendors develop on their own.

#### BLE
![theta_example2](../assets/img/products/theta-plugin/theta_example2.png)  
RICOH THETA can use BLE and be asigned as either Peripheral or Central. The THETA can use communication protocols after a connection is established as long as the Android library is exposed. The THETA plugin SDK can import and use these libraries.

#### Wi-Fi
![theta_example3](../assets/img/products/theta-plugin/theta_example3.png)  
The THETA can be configured both as an access point or a client. When the THETA is in Access Point Mode, other devices can connect to it using Ad Hoc Mode. It is also possible to connect a THETA to the Access Point in Infrastructure Mode. With this mode, THETA can be connected to internet.

#### Gyro Acceleration Sensor
![theta_example4](../assets/img/products/theta-plugin/theta_example4.png)  
Movement of a THETA can be detected using the gyro sensor or the accelerometer.

We provide plugins to enhance the following camera features: directional adjustment for shooting pictures, external device linkage and cloud transfer.
